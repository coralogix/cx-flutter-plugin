# Changelog

## 0.1.2

* **CxDioInterceptor:** New interceptor for Dio HTTP client. Add `CxDioInterceptor()` to your `Dio` instance to automatically capture network requests, generate RUM spans, and inject W3C `traceparent` headers — no migration from your existing networking layer required.
* **Expanded network context:** Both `CxHttpClient` and `CxDioInterceptor` now report `status_text`, `request_headers`, `response_headers`, `request_payload`, `response_payload`, and `error_message` in addition to the existing fields. `traceId`/`spanId` are now forwarded to the native Android SDK.
* **NetworkCaptureRule:** New `networkCaptureConfig` option on `CXExporterOptions`. Supply a list of `CxNetworkCaptureRule` objects to control which headers and payloads are captured per URL. Rules are matched in order (first match wins); when no rules are configured, no headers or payloads are captured.
* **Android SDK 2.9.2:** Bumped from 2.9.0.

## 0.1.1

* **Hybrid user interaction:** When user enables `userActions` in options, Dart tracks click/scroll/swipe; iOS always receives `userActions: false` to avoid duplicate events.
* **setUserInteraction:** iOS forwards interaction payload to native SDK (2.2.0). Android forwards via `reportUserInteraction` (native SDK 2.9.0); returns error when `event_name` is missing or when SDK is not initialized (iOS).
* **Context types aligned with native:** EventContext `source`; DeviceContext `operating_system`/`os_version`, `network_connection_type`/`network_connection_subtype`, `user_agent`; ErrorContext `exception_type`; NetworkRequestContext `request_headers`/`response_headers`/`request_payload`/`response_payload`; InteractionContext `target_element`, `element_classes`, `target_element_inner_text`, `scroll_direction` with `toJson()` omitting nulls for beforeSend round-trip.
* Native iOS SDK 2.2.0; native Android SDK 2.9.0.
* Android: compileSdk 36 (plugin and example).

**Breaking Change: Flutter SDK Requirement**
* The package now requires Flutter >=3.27.0 (as specified in `pubspec.yaml` environment: `flutter: '>=3.27.0'`)
